## üí¨ Summary
For those passing by. Hey there. Not gonna say the same line everyone else is in this section you know **"I code"** because its so obvious, like just to put it into perspective. You're on Github (trademark, ~~github inc~~ microsoft) everyone here is coding almost, but I'll probably have it in my bio in-case someone is looking for that. Though I do have a lot of fun coding. I'm usually part of a team or I'm doing some form of freelancing. So I rarely have time to contribute to open source hence I've got plenty of private commits, but of recent I've been wanting to contribute more to open source and occasionally help out fun projects that're open source when I have time to spare. 

Below are some of the languages, frameworks, and libraries I'm familiar with.
